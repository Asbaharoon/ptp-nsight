<p>Synchronized projects consist of files that are mirrored on the local system as well as on the remote system.
Editing occurs locally and each file is sync'd with the remote system when it is changed, created, or deleted.  
This enables faster interaction with the files
and editor, more CDT editor features since the files are local, and continued interaction for editing etc. if the network
connection is lost.
<p>
<h2 id=prereq>Requirements for Synchronized Projects</h2>
<p>To host a synchronized project, the remote system must:
<ul>
<li>Support the <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> distributed version control system</li>
<li>Support Java (1.5 or later) to allow Remote Tools (or RSE) as Remote Provider
    <ul><li>
    More information about Remote Tools as a remote service provider is in the section about
    <a href="02resMgrSetup.html#remote">remote Resource Managers</a>.
    </li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=create>Creating a new Synchronized Project</h2>
<p>To create a new Synchronized Project, Select <b>File > New > Other...</b>
and in the wizard selection dialog, select <b>Remote > Synchronized Project</b>.
<p><img src="images/sync-newproj.png">
<p>Or, from the context menu (right-mouse) in the Project Explorer,
select <b>New > Synchronized Project</b>
<p><img src="images/sync-newprojContext.png">
<p>Then give the project a name and select a project type
<p><img src="images/sync-newprojCreate.png">
<p>Select Next >
<p>On the next page, select a Synchronization Provider (Git) and selected an existing connection or create a new one. 
<p><img src="images/sync-newprojNewConnection.png">
<p>Here we create a new remote connection with the <b>Remote Tools</b> Remote Provider by selecting the <b>New...</b> button.
The Target Environment Configuration dialog is shown. Fill in host name, user, and password (or other authentication
information).
<p><img src="images/sync-newprojConnection.png">
<p>Select Finish.  The connection will be tested at this
point before returning to the <b>Configure Remote Synchronization</b> page.

<p>Back on the the <b>Configure Remote Synchronization</b> page:
<p><img src="images/sync-newprojConfigLocn.png">
<p>Specify a remote location by selecting <b>Browse...</b>
<p>A <b>Browse Directory</b> dialog appears in which you can navigate to find the directory
in which your new project's files will be contained on the remote system.
<p>Hit <b>OK</b> to return.
<p>The <b>Configure Remote Synchronization</b> page now contains the location of the remote files:

<p>Hit <b>Finish</b> to complete project creation.
<p>&nbsp;

<h2 id="work">Working with a Synchronized Project</h2>
<p>Edit the files as you would any local project.
Each time you save a file, the remote copy of the file is saved on the remote system.
If you create or delete files, the remote system is updated appropriately.
