<p>Synchronized projects consists of files that are mirrored on the local system as well as on the remote system.
Editing occurs locally and the project may be built locally as well, enabling faster interaction with the files
and editor, more CDT editor features since the files are local, and continued interaction for editing etc. if the network
connection is lost.
