<h1>Local vs Remote Projects</h1>
<p>Projects comprise the source code, build rules (e.g. makefiles),
and build results (e.g. object files and executables) for a particular application. These projects can reside in a number of different
locations, including on the user's local machine, on a remote systems, or in a source code repository. The target systems on which these 
applications run are also typically located at remote sites, though user's may also want to run the applications on their local machines.
<p>
To cater for as many situations as possible, PTP supports a variety of project and target system configurations. In addition to normal
Eclipse projects, PTP adds two new project types. With PTP installed, the user has the choice of the following project types:
<dl>
<dt><a href="#local">Local projects</a><dt>
<dd>These projects exist on the local machine which is the same machine on which Eclipse is running.</dd>
<dt><a href="#remote">Remote projects</a></dt>
<dd>These projects consist of source code and other files that exist exclusively on a remote target machine.</dd>
<dt><a href="#sync">Synchronized projects</a></dt>
<dd>These projects are a hybrid of the two; source code is located on <i>both</i> the local system and on
a remote target machine. These two copies are kept "in sync" by Eclipse.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
In addition to the project location, there are two other activities that depend on the user's desired working environment and target system
configuration. These include where the project will be built, and where the application will be launched (including where it will be launched in order to
be debugged.) These activities tend to be interrelated, since, for example, launching an application requires access to the executable. But if the executable
is built locally, and should be launched on a remote system, then it will need to be staged to the remote machine. Similarly, if the executable is
to be built and launched remotely, the location of the executable must be known for it to be launched.

<p>
The projects and services provided by PTP can operate both locally and remotely. In order to determine how to access local and remote files and
systems, PTP uses a number of <i>remote service providers</i>. There are three remote service providers that are available to PTP:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>Local</dt>
<dd>This service provider operates directly on the local machine (where Eclipse is running).</dd>
<dt>Remote Tools</dt>
<dd>This service provider is part of PTP and provides a light-weight wrapper around the ssh protocol. It provides features such as port forwarding (to avoid
firewall problems). It is part of PTP and is the recommended remote service provider, since it is
simpler to set up and contains all you need for PTP remote projects. 
More information about Remote Tools as a remote service provider is in the section about
<a href="02resMgrSetup.html#remote">remote Resource Managers</a>.</dd>
<dt><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/dsdp/tm">Remote Systems Explorer</a> (RSE)</dt>
<dd>This service provider is an optional component that provides support for a variety of protocols, including ssh, telnet, and ftp, as well as a custom
DataStore protocol. It also provides a separate user interface for displaying and interacting with files on remote systems. The section on 
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.ptp.rdt.doc.user/html/toc.html">Remote Development Tools</a> 
is written describing the use of RSE as the remote service provider.
RSE may be used if your remote system does not use the ssh protocol for remote connections, 
or you wish to use the additional functionality that RSE provides.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="local">Local Projects</h2>
<p>Local projects are the default type for Eclipse projects.  All files reside on the local machine, which is the same machine
on which Eclipse is running.  The section <a href="01buildMPIprog.html">Creating MPI Projects</a> 
describes mostly this type of local project. These projects may have been checked
out or cloned from a source repository, but the user is working on a local copy of the code. Updates to the repository must be controlled
manually by the user.
</p>
<p>
Local projects can only be built locally, but the executable can be run either locally or remotely. However, an executable built locally can
be run remotely only if both the local and remote machines have the same architecture, or the executable was built using a cross compiler. 
</p>
<h2 id="remote">Remote Projects</h2>
<p><a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.ptp.rdt.doc.user/html/toc.html">Remote Development Tools</a> 
(RDT) is part of PTP that provides the ability for C and C++ projects to be located and developed
remotely. Fortran projects can also be developed using RDT, but certain functionality (such as content assist and searching) will not be available.
In a remote project, the source code and other files are located on a remote system but appear to the user as if they
are on the local machine. When the project is built, the build happens on the remote system and the resulting executable will be
located on the remote system also. Launching the executable requires a resource manager that has been configured to use
the remote target system.
</p>
<p>
When creating a remote project, the <b>New Remote C/C++ Project</b> wizard allows the user to choose which type of remote service
provider to use, as shown below:

Remote projects have a number of limitations. In order to work on the remote project, the user requires a constant network connection to the remote system,
which precludes off-line development. Some Eclipse features are also not available on remote projects. Remote projects can only be checked out or cloned from
a version control system on the remote system, and the user will have no access to the normal Team functionality through the Eclipse user interface.
Remote projects do have the advantage that a copy of the source code is not required on the user's system, which may be a requirement in some environments.
<h2 id="sync">Synchronized Projects (new for 5.0)</h2>
<p>Synchronized projects maintain a copy of the source code and other project files on both the local system and the remote system.
Editing and other Eclipse functions happen locally, then each file is synchronized with the remote system when it is changed, created, or deleted.
</p>
<p>
This enables faster interaction with the files
and editor, more editor features since the files are local, and continued interaction for editing etc. if the network
connection is lost.
