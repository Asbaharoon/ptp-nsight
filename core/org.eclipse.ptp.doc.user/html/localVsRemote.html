<h1>Local vs Remote Projects</h1>
<p>PTP can operate on local, remote, and synchronized projects.
<ul>
<li><a href="#local">
Local projects</a> exist on the local machine (the same machine on which Eclipse is installed).
<li><a href="#remote">Remote projects</a> consist of files that exist on a remote target machine, which may be the same machine
on which the remote build, run, and debug happens, although this can vary.
<li><a href="#sync">Synchronized projects</a> are mirrored both places
</ul>
<h2 id="local">Local Projects</h2>
<p>Local projects are the original type of Eclipse and CDT project.  All files are on the local machine: the machine
on which Eclipse is installed.  The descriptions in <a href="01buildMPIprog.html">Creating MPI Projects</a> 
describe mostly local projects.
<h2 id="remote">Remote Projects</h2>
<p><a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.ptp.rdt.doc.user/html/toc.html">Remote Development Tools</a> 
(RDT) is part of the PTP Project and provides the ability for CDT projects to be located and developed
remotely.  RDT requires a "Remote Provider" for its Remote C/C++ projects.
Two types of remote providers are currently available: <b>Remote Tools</b> and
<b>Remote Systems Explorer (RSE)</b>.

You choose which of these your projects uses in the "Remote Provider" selection box of the New Remote Project dialog.

<p>The two types of remote providers currently available are:
<ul>
<li><b>
Remote Tools</b> is a light-weight ssh-only set of tools for communicating   
with remote systems. It is part of PTP and is the recommended remote service provider, since it is
simpler to set up and contains all you need for PTP remote projects. 
More information about Remote Tools as a remote service provider is in the section about
<a href="02resMgrSetup.html#remote">remote Resource Managers</a>.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/dsdp/tm">Remote Systems Explorer</a> (RSE) is part of the DSDP Target   
Management project. It's a complete remote environment that supports a   
variety of protocols.  
(PTP pre-reqs should pull in RSE requirements, but you can also install it separately.)
The section on 
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.ptp.rdt.doc.user/html/toc.html">Remote Development Tools</a> 
is written describing the use of RSE as the remote service provider.
RSE may be used if your remote system does not use the ssh protocol for remote connections, 
or you wish to use the additional functionality that RSE provides.
</li>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;
<h2 id="sync">Synchronized Projects</h2>
<p>Synchronized projects consist of files that are mirrored on the local system as well as on the remote system.
Editing occurs locally and each file is sync'd with the remote system when it is changed, created, or deleted.  
This enables faster interaction with the files
and editor, more CDT editor features since the files are local, and continued interaction for editing etc. if the network
connection is lost.
See <a href="sync.html">Synchronized Projects</a> for more information.<p>&nbsp;
