<h1 id="top">PTP Remote Tools</h1>
<p><b>Remote Tools</b> is a lightweight remote service provider that is included
with the Parallel Tools Platform (PTP).



To access the remote target system, PTP supports a number of
<i>remote service providers</i>. 
Currently supported remote service providers include <b>Remote Tools</b> (part of PTP) and 
the <b>Eclipse Remote Systems Explorer (RSE)</b> which is an optional package that can be installed at any time. 
<b>The preferred remote service provider is Remote Tools</b> which supports all the PTP and Remote Development Tools (RDT) 
functionality, however
some installations use additional features that are only available in RSE. 
Most PTP information is described using <b>Remote Tools</b>, since it is the simplest and easiest to use.</p>
<p>See also <a href="localVsRemote.html">Local vs. Remote Projects</a> for more information on local and remote
projects, and the different service providers.
<h2 id="edit">Editing Remote Connections</h2>
<p>To edit remote connection information after a connection is created, e.g. to change userid, password, etc.,
first select the <b>Remote Environments</b> view.

<p>To edit a connection, it must first be stopped.  To stop a connection, select it and use the "red box"
action on the <b>Remote Environments</b> view toolbar.

<p>Once stopped, edit the connection via the context menu (right mouse)
<p><img src="images/rt_remoteEnv_edit.png">
<p>Then make any changes to the connection and select <b>Finish</b>
<p><img src="images/rt_editConnection.png">
<p>The connection need not be manually restarted.  It will automatically restart the next
time communication with the target machine is needed.
