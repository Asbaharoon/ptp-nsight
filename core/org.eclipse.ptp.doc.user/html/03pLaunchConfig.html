<h1 id="top">Running Parallel Programs</h1>
<p>This section describes how to run a parallel program. In PTP,
this is called &quot;launching a job&quot;. Launching requires the
services of a resource manager, which should have been set up as
described in <a href="02resMgrSetup.html">Resource Managers</a>. PTP is
able to launch parallel applications that use a variety of programming
models (e.g. MPI, OpenMP, UPC, etc.) provided that the resource manager
supports the programming model. It is also possible to launch multiple
copies of a sequential program so that they execute simultaneously.</p>

<p>Eclipse uses a <i>launch configuration</i> to encapsulate all the
settings and arguments necessary to launch a job normally or under the
control of a debugger. A launch configuration is created using the <b>Run
&gt; Run Configurations...</b> menu. 

<p>This section only describes how to launch a parallel program. A
description of how to monitor the application launch is provided in 
<a href="05monitoring.html">Monitoring Jobs and Systems</a>. A
description of how to debug an application is provided in 
<a href="06parDebugging.html">Parallel Debugging</a>.</p>

<h2 id="create">Step 1: Create a Parallel Application launch
configuration</h2>
<p>Note: At least one resource manager must have been configured
before it is possible to create a parallel application run
configuration.</p>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p>To set up a launch configuration, open the <b>Run Configuration</b>
	dialog using <b>Run &gt; Run Configurations...</b> or click the run
	icon menu on the tool bar and select <b>Run Configuration...</b>.</p>
	</p>
	<p><br>
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Create a new Parallel Application launch configuration by
	clicking <b>Parallel Application</b> and then clicking on the <b>New</b>
	button icon.</p>
	<p><br>
	</p>
	<p><img src="images/03launch1.png"></p>
	<p><br>
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Enter a name for the configuration in the <b>Name:</b> field.
	Here we use the same name as the project.</p>
	<p><br>
	</p>
	<p><img src="images/03launch1a.png"></p>
	</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="resources">Step 2: Complete the Resources tab</h2>
<p>The <b>Resources tab</b> is used to specify the resources
required for the job execution. The contents of this tab will vary for
different resource managers. This description only applys to the Open
MPI and MPICH2 resource managers.</p>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Select a resource manager you wish to use from the drop-down. If the resource manager you have selected is not running,
	then you will see a warning message in the dialog.</p>
	<p><br>
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Enter a value in the <b>Number of Processes</b> field. This
	field must be greater than 0 in order to launch a job, and specifies
	the number of processes to use for the application launch.</p>
	<p><br>
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Fields in the <b>Options</b> section correspond to command-line
	options supported by Open MPI. If desired, it is also possible to
	specify a file containing the list of hosts on which to run the
	application using the <b>Host file</b> field, or the list can be
	entered directly into the <b>Host list</b> field.</p>
	<p><br>
	</p>
	<p><img src="images/03launchResTab.png"></p>
	</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="application">Step 3: Complete the <b>Application</b> tab</h2>
<p>The <b>Application tab</b> is used to specify the application
(executable) to be launched.</p>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Ensure that the correct the <b>Parallel Project</b> is selected.
	This is the project containing the source and binaries for the
	application.</p>
	<p><br>
	</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	<p>Select the <b>Application Program</b> (executable) you wish to
	launch. If the resource manager is connected to a remote target, then
	this means the <i>path of the executable on the remote target</i>.
	Otherwise, for a resource manager on the local machine, it should be
	the path to the executable within the project directory.</p>
	<p><br>
	</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	<p>If you are running the application on a remote machine and the
	project was <i>built</i> locally, then you will have to copy the
	executable to the remote machine first. For this purpose, you may
	enable <b>Copy executable from local filesystem</b> and fill <b>Path
	to the local file</b> with the path to the executable within the project
	directory. This configures the launcher to copy the executable
	automatically to the remote target before starting the run/debug
	session. If not enabled, then you will need to copy the executable
	manually to the remote target.</p>
	<p><br>
	</p>
	</li>
	<p><img src="images/03launch6.png"></p>
	<p><br>
	</p>

	<li>
	<p>If you wish to have the output from all processes in a single
	output console, ensure that the <b>Display output from all
	processes in a console view</b> option is checked.</p>
	<p><br>
	</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="arguments">Step 4: Complete the Arguments tab</h2>
<p>The <b>Arguments tab</b> is used to specify any command-line
arguments require by the parallel application and to modify the working
directory.</p>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Enter any arguments required by the application in the <b>Parallel
	program arguments</b> field. This is a free form text field that will be
	passed to the application verbatim.</p>
	<p><br>
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Select a different working directory if desired. The working
	directory is set just prior to the application launch. Note that for a
	remote launch, this will be a directory on the remote machine.</p>
	</li>
	<p><img src="images/03launch3.png"></p>
	<p><br>
	</p>
</ol>

<h2 id="environment">Step 5: Complete the Environment tab</h2>
<p>The <b>Environment tab</b> is used to specify any environment
variables require by the parallel application or in order to run the
application. The tab also provides the option to append the environment
variables to the native environment, or to replace the native
environment with the variables specified in the tab.</p>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Use the <b>New...</b> button to create a new environment
	variable.</p>
	<p><br>
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Use the <b>Select...</b> button to import environment variables.</p>
	<p><br>
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Use the <b>Edit...</b> button to edit an environment variables.</p>
	<p><br>
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Use the <b>Remove...</b> button to remove an environment
	variables.</p>
	<p><br>
	</p>
	</li>
	<p><img src="images/03launch4.png"></p>
	<p><br>
	</p>
</ol>

<h2 id="synchronize">Step 6: Complete the <b>Synchronize</b> tab</h2>
<p>The <b>Synchronize tab</b> is used in scenarios where the
resource manager is connected to a remote target. The tab specifies
rules that describe files or directories that need to be copied (<i>uploaded</i>)
to the remote target before starting the parallel application execution.
Typically, this feature is used to upload dependencies (like dynamic
libraries) or input data for test cases.</p>
<p>This tab also allows to specify rules describing files on the
remote host to be retrieved back (<i>downloaded</i>) to the local host
after the parallel application finishes execution, as output data
produced by the parallel application execution.</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>If you wish to enable file transfer to the remote target, enable
	the <b>Upload rules enabled</b> or <b>Download rules enabled</b>
	according which direction of file transfer is required.</p>
	<p><br>
	</p>
	<p><img src="images/03launch7.png"></p>
	<p><br>
	</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	<p>In order to specify files to be copied from the local system to
	the remote target (<i>uploaded</i>), click on <b>New upload rule</b>.
	An upload rule lists a collection of files or directories that shall be
	copied into a single directory.</p>
	<p><br>
	</p>
	<p>If <b>Use directory from launch configuration</b> is enabled,
	then the listed files or directories are copied to the working
	directory specified on the launch configuration. At the moment, this is
	equivalent to same directory that contains the executable for the
	parallel application. If not enabled, they you must specify on <b>Remote
	directory</b> a path where the files or directories will be placed. The
	path may be absolute or relative (to the working directory).</p>
	<p><br>
	</p>
	<p>In the list underneath, <b>Selected file(s)</b>, add the files
	or directories that shall be copied. Click on <b>File(s)</b> to select
	one or more individual files from anywhere in the local file system.
	The <b>Directory</b> button works similarly to select a directory from
	the local file system. Directories are copied recursively. The <b>Workspace</b>
	button allows easily choosing files from the current workspace.</p>
	<p><br>
	</p>
	<p>On the bottom of the dialog, you may wish to set attributes to
	be applied to the copied files on the remote target. The options <b>Readonly</b>
	or <b>Executable</b> sets all copied files to read-only or executable
	on the remote host. If <b>Preserve time attributes</b> is enabled, then
	the remote copy will assume the same time stamp then the local file,
	otherwise, the time stamp will be the time the file was copied. Also,
	if the file already exists on the remote target, you may choose how to
	react in the <b>If file already exists</b> dropdown.</p>
	<p><br>
	</p>
	<p><img src="images/03launch8.png"></p>
	<p><br>
	</p>
	<p><br>
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>In order to specify files to be copied from the remote target to
	the local system (<i>downloaded</i>) after the parallel application
	finishes, click on <b>New download rule</b>.</p>
	<p><br>
	</p>
	<p>An download rule lists a collection of files or directories that
	shall be copied into a single local directory. Its options are very
	similar to the upload rule.</p>
	<p><br>
	</p>
	<p><img src="images/03launch9.png"></p>
	<p><br>
	</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="launch">Step 7: Launching the application</h2>
<p>The launch configuration is now complete. Click on the <b>Apply</b>
button to save the configuration and then
click on the <b>Run</b> button to launch the job.
Switch to the <b>Parallel Runtime</b> perspective (or <b>System Monitoring</b> perspective)
to view the status of the job and inspect the program output.
