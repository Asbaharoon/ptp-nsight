<h1>SLURM Resource Manager for PTP</h1>
<h2><A name=introduction></A>Introduction</h2>
<p>The SLURM Eclipse plug-in, part of the 
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.ptp.doc.user/html/toc.html">Parallel Tools Platform</a> (PTP),  
allows you to run a parallel application using the Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM) from within the PTP framework.
In addition to running applications, you can monitor their status, control their execution, and view their stdio
output from within PTP. You can also debug a parallel application using the built in PTP parallel debugger. </p>
<p>You can run and debug parallel applications either as local projects or as remote projects, using the remote development 
environment support that is part of PTP.</p>
<p>This plugin consists of two parts. The first is the Eclipse PTP plugin code which is responsible for the PTP views 
presented to the user and the user's interaction with those views. The second part is a resource manager (proxy), which is
responsible for communicating with the PTP SLURM plugin code, invoking the parallel application, and reporting application
status to the PTP SLURM plugin.</p>


<!-- NEEDS UPDATING FOR PTP 6.0 -->
<p><b>Note:</b> PTP 6.0 does not require the creation of separate <i>Resource Managers</i>
and instead, the target configuration is specified on the Run Configuration dialog.
This document has not yet been updated for PTP 6.0, but the Resources tab on the
new Run Configuration menu should have approximately the same information as 
the Resource manager setup dialog described here, but this can vary depending on the 
target configuration / resource manager.
