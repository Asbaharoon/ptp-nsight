		We provide <a href="http://download.eclipse.org/tools/ptp/docs/JAXBDemo.pdf">an introductory tutorial slide set</a> demonstrating some
		simple additions to a pre-existing configuration file.
		For some example XML illustrating various aspects of the schema
		(particularly UI features), we also provide a <a
			href="http://download.eclipse.org/tools/ptp/docs/JAXBExamples_5.0.1.1.zip">.zip file (for PTP release 5.0.1)</a>.

	<p>The preference options are aids for debugging configuration
		changes. The first turns off configuration file caching. This will ensure
		that when you make changes to the configuration, they will automatically be
		picked up by PTP.</p>

	<p>The other options are useful if you are writing a new stream
		tokenizer for a command; checking all four options usually produces
		quite a bit of output, so in that case it may be advisable to log the
		results to a file rather than stdout (at any rate the latter would be
		available only if PTP were running as an application within the
		Eclipse IDE platform, which is not the case for those modifying the
		XML simply from within the PTP package installation workspace).</p>
