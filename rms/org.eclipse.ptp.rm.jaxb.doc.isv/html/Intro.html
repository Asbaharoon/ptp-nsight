		PTP allows you to launch and monitor
		applications on local or remote resources using systems
		which are configured from an XML file via JAXB (
		<code>javax.xml.bind</code>
		) technology.<br>
	</p>

	<p>The target system configuration files:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Allow for maximum adaptability. Often job schedulers (PBS,
			LSF, LoadLeveler, etc.) or interactive runtime systems (OpenMPI, PE,
			SLURM, etc.) are set up by system administrators in special or
			non-standard ways which make it difficult to use a generic tool. The
			configuration file allows a user or community of users to fit the
			resource manager to a class of systems, to a single host, or even to
			special application usage.</li>
		<li>Simplify adding support for new systems. Building the resource manager 
			control system and its UI presentation from an
			XML configuration means that in most cases no special Java coding is
			necessary. Users should be able to accommodate new systems, at least
			on the client-end, without writing and loading additional Eclipse
			plugins. (The only qualification here is that the monitoring
			component also support that type of scheduler or runtime; see the
			following paragraphs.)</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		A target system configuration consist of two components, a
		"control" component, which governs the configuration, launch and cancellation of
		individual jobs entirely from the client end, and a "monitoring" component, which
		displays job status as well as global information about the HPC
		resource. The monitoring system uses built-in types provided
		by the PTP distribution which support most standard scheduler types. Adding
		a new configuration will normally entail only the specification of
		its control part. The default mode of usage is that
		the client stages the necessary components (mostly Perl
		scripts) automatically, but in a future release, the monitor will also
		be capable of connecting directly to a system-wide (web-based)
		deployment.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The "control" component of the target configuration is associated with a remote connection
		when the user configures a "Parallel Application" run configuration using the standard Eclipse launch
		configuration mechanism. This remote connection is the used whenever the control system 
		needs to send or receive data, such as when running a command, or copying a file.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The "monitor" component of the target configuration is associated with a remote connection
		via the "Monitors" view in the "System Monitoring" perspective. This connection is used for
		sending and receiving data required to perform the monitoring activities. Note that the
		"control" and "monitor" component's remote connections are independent, although they can
		both share the same connection (which is the normal case).
	</p>

			definition. Those interested only in using configurations
			already provided with the PTP distribution should consult the User
			Guide under the relevant scheduler section.</b>
