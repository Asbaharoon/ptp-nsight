	<h2>
		User Interface
	</h2>
	
	<h3>
		<a name="LaunchTab">The Resources Tab</a>
	</h3>

	<p>
		The UI component which needs to be configured in conjunction with the
		resource manager control is the <b>Launch Tab</b>, which is actually
		the main area of the <b>Resources Tab</b>, one of the six tabs
		comprising the <b>Run Configuration</b> wizard or the seven tabs
		comprising the <b>Debug Configuration</b> wizard. The purpose of this
		component is to allow the user to set up the job by providing values
		relating to resource requirements or to the properties of the job in
		general. In other words, it is in this component that the user can set
		the values on the
		<code>attribute</code>
		elements making up the configurable environment as defined in the XML.
	</p>

	<p>
		Specifying the composition and layout of this component can be tricky
		and tedious because it deals with widgets defined by the Eclipse
		<code>JFace</code>
		library and with their underlying implementation in
		<code>SWT</code>
		. We intend in the near future to provide some standard "templates"
		for typical widget groups that can be cut and pasted into the XML
		definition. Some of this can already be achieved by importing into the
		workspace a provided definition (such as for the PBS resource manager)
		and modifying it or borrowing from it. This is, in fact, the approach
		demostrated in the <a href="http://download.eclipse.org/tools/ptp/docs/JAXBDemo.pdf">tutorial</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b> Throughout the following, it may generally be assumed that
			fields such as <i>style</i>, <i>foreground</i>, <i>background</i>,
			etc., take string equivalents of the corresponding <code>SWT</code>
			constants (e.g., "SWT.LEFT", "SWT.VERTICAL", "SWT.NONE") which can be
			OR'd (using "|") wherever they would be in Java code. We will <i>not</i>
			exhaustively specify here which constants pertain to which widgets,
			because in most cases we have tried to reflect very closely the names
			of the <code>SWT</code> object types and fields, and this information
			can be found by consulting the Javadocs relative to the widgets in
			question. </b>
	</p>

	<img alt="LaunchTabType" src="images/13launch-tab.jpeg" />

	<p>
		As seen from this top-level specification, the Launch Tab can have any
		number of
		<code>dynamic</code>
		tab-controllers, "dynamic" meaning configurable from the XML, which
		will discuss in more detail in the following paragraphs.
	</p>
	<p>
		There is also a fixed
		<code>import</code>
		controller type (implemented as an extension/subclass of the dynamic
		controller, in order to provide uniform handling of the environment);
		this component allows you to browse the workspace to set a custom
		script as the one to run. Its main text area widget is read-only; any
		editing of the script must be done through the workspace editor. The
		browse is local only, so remote scripts should first be imported into
		a local project in the workspace (using the remote systems import
		wizard), and then captured by this controller's browse button.
	</p>

	<p>
		The configurable part of the import tab is an optional <a
			href="#AttributeViewer">attribute viewer</a> for selecting the
		variables from the environment which you wish to pass to the launch
		command along with the script. <i>The values set here should
			correspond to whatever the script contains; they are set for the
			benefit of the internal consistency of the PTP client, and do not
			override those hard-coded in script.</i> For an example, see the <a
			href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.ptp.rm.jaxb.pbs.doc.user/html/PBSHelpPage.html#ImportTab">Import
			PBS Script</a> tab.
	</p>

	<h3>
		<a name="TabController">Tab Controller</a>
	</h3>

	<p>
		The
		<code>dynamic</code>
		controllers belong to the
		<code>tab-controller-type</code>, which contains an arbitrary number of
		<code>tab-folder,</code>
		<code>composite,</code>
		<code>widget,</code>
		<code>browse,</code>
		<code>button-group,</code>
		<code>action,</code>
		or
		<code>viewer</code>
		elements; as will be seen shortly, the first two, which are
		"containers", are potentially recursive elements, so that one can nest
		widgets in the usual manner. For all intents and purposes, the
		<code>tab-controller-type</code>
		is the same as a
		<code>composite</code>, but without the <i>group</i> attribute and with the extra field for
		controlling shared widgets.
	</p>

	<img alt="TabController" src="images/14tab-controller.jpeg" />
	<p>
		The <i>includeWidgetValuesFrom</i> field is important. By default, it
		is set to empty, meaning that the subset of the total resource manager
		environment represented by the controller's widgets is all that will
		be passed to the actual job configuration when the job is launched
		from this tab. This behavior can be changed by giving a
		comma-delimited list of the
		<code>title</code>
		values for other controllers. In this case, the configuration for the
		job, when the "Run" button is pressed with this controller being the
		visible one, will also include <i>all the attributes
			valid for the listed but currently invisible controllers</i>.
	</p>
	
	<blockquote>
	<div style="border: 1px solid ;">
	<h5>
		<a name="Note3">ATTRIBUTE NAMES vs VALUES</a>
	</h5>

	<p>While this field controls the inclusion or exclusion of
		attribute names in the configuration, their values are
		always shared across the controllers (there is only one environment);
		thus if a variable value is changed on one controller, and this
		variable is also exposed on another, the value for that variable will
		also change on the other controller when it becomes visible;
		similarly, if the user switches off a controller to another having
		only a subset of the first controller's variables, the variables not
		represented on the second controller will become undefined or return
		to their defaults.</p>
	<p>
		<b>Note</b> that the union of valid names is not transitively closed;
		that is, if Tab1 has <i>includeWidgetValuesFrom</i>="Tab2", and Tab2
		similarly has <i>includeWidgetValuesFrom</i>="Tab3", Tab1 will get
		only the valid values local to Tab2. <b>Note</b> also, that if there
		are names which intersect with strictly local widget targets, the
		local settings (visibility, selection, enablement) still determine
		whether they belong in the set of valid attribute names.
	</p>
	</div>
	</blockquote>
	
	<p>
		The <i>showViewConfig</i> and <i>showViewExcluded</i> fields allow
		control over whether the "View Configuration" and "View Excluded"
		buttons appear at the bottom of the tab (the "View Script" button
		appears if the configuration contains a
		<code>script</code>
		element). <i>showViewConfig</i> is true by default; this button brings
		up a scrolling dialog which allows you to inspect the current
		configuration (that is, the one relevant to the visible controller). <i>showViewExcluded</i>
		is by default false, and should only be set if the resource manager
		processes attributes discovered by a command at run
		time; this dialog allows you to see which ones have been marked
		invisible; <b>unlike invisible predefined attributes</b>,
		which are always <i>included</i>, invisible discovered
		attributes are always <i>excluded</i> from the configuration and thus
		do not persist across resource manager sessions.
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3>
		<a name="TabFolders">Tab Folders and Tab Items</a>
	</h3>

	<img alt="TabFolder" src="images/15tab-folder.jpeg" />
	<p>
		The
		<code>tab-folder</code>
		is a container which looks like a file-folder, with tabs running
		across the top or bottom (<i>style</i> includes SWT.TOP, SWT.BOTTOM).
		Each tab label corresponds to a
		<code>tab-item</code>
		which provides the actual visible content. The
		<code>tooltip</code>
		pertains to the entire folder.
	</p>

	<p>
		The
		<code>tab-item</code>
		is another all-purpose "container" in which all widget types can be
		embedded, but distinguished from the <a href="#Composite"><code>composite</code>
		</a> in that it can only be the child of a
		<code>tab-folder</code>
		and that it can have a tooltip (which appears on the tab).
	</p>

	<p>
		As with
		<code>composite</code>
		(see <a href="#Composite">below</a>), the tab folder and tab item take
		<code>layout</code>
		and
		<code>layout-data</code>
		elements; these closely reflect their
		<code>SWT</code>
		objects and types; for further explanation we refer the reader once
		again to the relevant Javadocs.
	</p>

	<h3>
		<a name="Layout">Layout</a>
	</h3>
	<img alt="Layout" src="images/17layout.jpeg" />
	<h3>
		<a name="LayoutData">Layout Data</a>
	</h3>
	<img alt="LayoutData" src="images/18layout-data.jpeg" />

	<h3>
		<a name="Composite">Composite/Group</a>
	</h3>

	<p>
		The main container, of course, is the
		<code>composite</code>
		; its sub-type, the group (<i>group</i>="true"), allows for decoration
		and a title, while the simple composite acts as a widget holder and
		has no visible characteristics, though it does have a layout. As is
		evident, composites can be contained in composites and tab-items, and
		tab-folders can be contained in composites.
	</p>

	<img alt="Composite" src="images/16composite.jpeg" />
	<br>

	<h3>
		<a name="ControlState">Control State Wiring</a>
	</h3>

	<p>
		It should be evident that all the XML elements corresponding to UI SWT
		<code>control</code>
		types have been given
		<code>control-state</code>
		children.
	</p>

	<img alt="Composite" src="images/22control-state.png" />
	<br>

	<p>
		The purpose of these elements is to provide an optional way of setting
		the <b>enabled</b> and/or <b>visible</b> states of the control on the
		basis of the state of button (checkbox/radio) selection or the value of an attribute. One can
		define two such elements per control, using one of the show/hide or
		enable/disable pairs. Each of these is associated with a
		<code>control-state-rule:</code>
	</p>

	<img alt="Composite" src="images/23control-state-rule.png" />
	<br>

	<p>The basic rule is defined by its attributes. Rules can specify either:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>the id of the button control to check (<i>button</i>)</li>
		<li>whether its selected state should be true or false (<i>selected</i>)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>or</p>

	<ul>
		<li>the name of an attribute (<i>attribute</i>)</li>
		<li>the value of the attribute (<i>value</i>).</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Only one combination of <i>button</i> and <i>selected</i> or <i>attribute</i> and <i>value</i> can be
	specified in a rule. Rules can be nested to an arbitrary depth to form clauses
		governed by the logical operators.</p>

	<p>
		When using a rule containing <i>button</i> and <i>selected</i>, the
		"trigger" button control must have an id unique to the resource
		manager configuration. This will be assigned via the <i>buttonId</i>
		attribute on the
		<code>widget</code>
		corresponding to the button (true also for the buttons nested in a
		<code>button-group</code>
		). For these rules, a
		<code>SelectionListener</code>
		is created for this target which subscribes to all the controls in the
		rule; when it receives an event, it evaluates the rule, and if the
		result is true, takes the associated action on this target.
	</p>
	
	<p>For rules that spectify <i>attribute</i> and <i>value</i>, the attribute value will be checked 
	when the attribute or any control is updated.</p>

	<p>Here is an example which sets the enabled and visible properties
		of both a text field and a related checkbox:</p>

	<pre>
               &lt;widget type="checkbox" buttonId="002" title="Host list:" attribute="checked002"&gt;
                  &lt;layout-data&gt;
                     &lt;grid-data horizontalAlign="SWT.LEFT" verticalAlign="SWT.TOP"/&gt;
                  &lt;/layout-data&gt;
                  &lt;control-state&gt;
                     &lt;show-if button="001" selected="true"/&gt;
                  &lt;/control-state&gt;
               &lt;/widget&gt;
               &lt;widget type="text" style="SWT.V_SCROLL | SWT.BORDER" attribute="host_list"&gt;
                  &lt;layout-data&gt;
                     &lt;grid-data horizontalAlign="SWT.FILL" verticalAlign="SWT.FILL" horizontalSpan="2" grabExcessHorizontal="true"
                        grabExcessVertical="true"/&gt;
                  &lt;/layout-data&gt;
                  &lt;control-state&gt;
                     &lt;show-if button="001" selected="true"/&gt;
                     &lt;enable-if&gt;
                        &lt;and&gt;
                           &lt;rule button="001" selected="true"/&gt;
                           &lt;rule button="002" selected="true"/&gt;
                        &lt;/and&gt;
                     &lt;/enable-if&gt;
                  &lt;/control-state&gt;
               &lt;/widget&gt; 
   </pre>

	<p>Note also that this implicit dependency graph is checked for
		cycles; the building of the UI tab will be aborted if such a cycle is
		discovered.</p>

	<blockquote>
	<div style="border: 1px solid ;">
	<h5>
		<a name="Note4">BEST PRACTICE: CONTROL STATE</a>
	</h5>
	<p>
		An invisible property should be assigned to each checkbox which
		controls the state of other widgets (e.g., <i>checked002</i> in the
		example above); this will allow you to restore the state of the tab
		correctly when it is rebuilt or re-initialized.
	</p>
	<br>
	</div>
	</blockquote>
	
	<h3>
		<a name="Widget">Widget</a>
	</h3>

	<p>
		We now come to the five non-container widget elements with functional
		characteristics. The first of these is the
		<code>widget</code>, which comprises a number of simple widget types.
	<p>

	<img alt="Widget" src="images/19widget.png" />

	<p>
		The <i>type</i> of the widget can be one of the following:
	</p>

	<br>
	<table align="center" rules="all">
		<tr>
			<td><code>label</code></td>
			<td>fixed text for display</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>text</code></td>
			<td>area for entering/editing text</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>checkbox</code></td>
			<td>corresponds to a boolean choice</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>radiobutton</code></td>
			<td>usually used in connection with <code>button-group</code></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>spinner</code></td>
			<td>provides a continuous range of integer values</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>combo</code></td>
			<td>select from a list of items</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<br>

	<p>
		Not all attributes and elements of the
		<code>widget</code>
		descriptor are applicable to all types.
	</p>
	<br>
	<table align="center" rules="all">
		<tr>
			<td><i>title</i></td>
			<td>used with <code>checkbox</code> and <code>radiobutton</code>
				widgets for the button label.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><i>style</i></td>
			<td>carries the <code>SWT</code> style constants appropriate to
				the widget type.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><i>readOnly</i></td>
			<td>applies to <code>text</code>, <code>spinner</code> and <code>combo</code>
				widgets; the text area in this case is not editable.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><i>attribute</i></td>
			<td>applies to all widgets except <code>label</code>; the name
				of the attribute whose value should be set on the basis
				of the widget's "selected" value or text.<br> <b>Note:</b> use
				of this attribute is mutually exclusive with the <code>fixed-</code>
				and <code>dynamic-text</code> elements.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>items-from</code></td>
			<td>applies to the <code>combo</code> widget; indicates an
				attribute <i>value</i> (of type <code>java.util.Collection</code>)
				to use to populate the items.<br> <b>Note:</b> if a combo
				widget saves its value to an attribute and the present element on
				the widget descriptor is not set, the attribute will be checked for
				non-empty <code>choice</code> or <code>items-from</code> values,
				which then will be used to populate the combo items; the <code>items-from</code>
				field on the widget is for added flexibility (for instance, linking
				up a target attribute with another attribute providing the list of
				choices).</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>fixed-text</code></td>
			<td>applies to the <code>label</code> and (read-only) <code>text</code>
				widgets; text is resolved once and remains constant thereafter.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>dynamic-text</code></td>
			<td>applies only to (read-only) <code>text</code> widgets; text
				is resolved each time there is an update of a value from the Launch
				Tab.</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<br>

	<p>Widget foreground, background (color) and font are in principle
		configurable, though the font setting may not always work. The tooltip
		will appear on the widget whereever it usually does.</p>
	<br>

	<h3>
		<a name="ButtonGroup">Button Group</a>
	</h3>

	<img alt="ButtonGroup" src="images/20button-group.png" />

	<p>
		The button group provides an explicit selection of a single value
		based on a mutually exclusive set of button labels. Just as with the
		<code>widget</code>, one uses <i>attribute</i> to indicate what attribute
		value to set. The
		<code>button</code>
		elements, which can be arranged horizontally or vertically using the <i>style</i>
		attribute (SWT.HORIZONTAL, SWT.VERTICAL), will be
		<code>widget</code>
		elements whose type is either <i>checkbox</i> or <i>radiobutton</i>
		(if a different widget type is given, an error will occur); the <i>attribute</i>
		attribute on the individual button will be ignored. Radio buttons are
		"sticky" in the sense that once they are selected, they cannot be
		"unchecked" until a different button in the group is selected. It is
		thus advisable always to provide a default value for the 
		attribute associated with the group value if radio buttons are used.
		If check boxes are used, they can be individually checked on and off
		(one at a time), thus allowing for the value of the group to be
		potentially empty.
	</p>

	<p>Below is an example of a button group using radio buttons,
		disposed vertically.</p>
	<br>
	<img alt="ButtonGroupExample" src="images/ButtonGroup.jpeg" />
	<br>
	<br>

	<h3>
		<a name="Browse">Browse</a>
	</h3>

	<img alt="BrowseType" src="images/190browse.png" />

	<p>
		A special widget-pair -- a text widget followed by a push button --
		allowing the user to browse directories or files from either the local
		or remote file system. Aside from the fields shared with the
		<code>widget</code>
		type, we note the following:
	</p>
	<br>
	<table align="center" rules="all">
		<tr>
			<td><i>directory</i></td>
			<td>limit the <code>browse</code> widget to directories.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><i>uri</i></td>
			<td>have the <code>browse</code> widget set a URI as the text
				(default is false, in which case the text is an absolute path).</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><i>localOnly</i></td>
			<td>limit the <code>browse</code> widget to the local file
				system (otherwise, the choice of local or remote is enabled).</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<br>
	<p>
		Control ids,
		<code>layout</code>
		and
		<code>control-state</code>
		are specified as belonging to either the text or the button. Style
		applies only to the text widget.
	</p>
	<br>

	<h3>
		<a name="Action">Action Button</a>
	</h3>

	<br>
	<img alt="ActionType" src="images/191push-button.jpeg" />
	<br>

	<p>
		A push button which is associated with a
		<code>button-action</code>
		command. The
		<code>button-action</code>
		specifies the name of a command (
		<code>action</code>
		) defined in the XML; this can be one of the
		<code>start-up</code>
		or
		<code>shut-down</code>
		commands, or a special
		<code>button-action</code>
		command (<b>note </b>that it cannot, however, be a <a href="#Note2"><b>(uu)id</b>
		</a> command, as the Launch Tab is not coupled to any submitted jobs); the
		<code>button-action-type</code>
		also indicates whether the variable affected by the command should be
		cleared prior to the command execution, and whether the launch tab
		should be refreshed (default is true) afterward.
	</p>
	<br>

	<h3>
		<a name="AttributeViewer">Attribute Viewer</a>
	</h3>

	<img alt="AttributeViewerType" src="images/21attribute-viewer.jpeg" />

	<p>
		The last of the widget types, the
		<code>attribute-viewer</code>, displays visible attributes in a table or tree
		viewer, with the value columns as editable widgets. The type of cell
		editor is determined implicitly here by the type of the
		attribute; the presence of a combo editor is determined by an
		attribute whose
		<code>choice</code>
		or
		<code>items-from</code>
		element is defined. (This is the only viable possibility for a combo
		in the table, as there would also need to be a target to save the
		selected item to, viz., the value of this same attribute.)
	</p>

	<p>Each entry in the viewer is provided with a checkbox to indicate
		which attributes have been chosen (and thus marked valid). A checkbox
		is also placed above the viewer to allow for filtering the unchecked
		items. The viewer outputs its values to the environment. The name of
		the viewer is also stored against a string of all selected values,
		constructed from a template (further discussion at the end of this
		section).</p>

	<p>
		The viewer <i>type</i> can be either "table" or "tree"; in the case of
		the tree, the type, default, status and description fields of the
		attribute are displayed as collapsible child rows hanging
		off the main name entry. Either table or tree can have up to <b>six</b>
		columns whose names/types are based on the following
		attribute fields:
	</p>

	<table align="center" rules="all">
		<tr>
			<td><b>Name</b></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><b>Value</b></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><b>Type</b></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><b>Status</b></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><b>Default</b></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><b>Description</b></td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<br>
	<p>
		These can appear in any order. There is a slight difference in how
		these columns are treated, depending upon whether <i>tree</i> or <i>table</i>
		is chosen as type. For <b>table</b> type, the value of the field
		simply appears in the corresponding column:
	</p>
	<br>
	<img alt="Table" src="images/Table.jpg" />
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>
		In the <b>tree</b> type, the
		<code>name</code>
		field displays all fields except
		<code>value</code>
		as children;
		<code>value</code>
		always appears as a separate column on the same row as the name (it
		contains the cell editor). If the viewer also has the column
		corresponding to the child field, that field value appears in that
		column;
	</p>

	<br>
	<img alt="Tree1" src="images/Tree1.jpg" />
	<br>
	<br>

	<p>
		Otherwise, the child fields display their value in the value column
		along with the actual
		<code>value</code>
		field:
	</p>

	<br>
	<img alt="Tree2" src="images/Tree2.jpg" />
	<br>
	<br>

	<p>
		Tooltips for the column appear when hovering over the column header. (<i>A
			caveat on the foreground and background settings for this type: they
			are exposed here but may not work as expected: these are currently
			applied to the column through the cell label provider; foreground
			does not change the font color but applies the color to the entire
			cell.</i>)
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>sort</i> is done on the name field/column. This is a toggle sort,
		such that alternate clicks reverse the sort direction. <i>headerVisible</i>
		and <i>linesVisible</i> control the look of the table. <i>tooltipEnabled</i>
		enables column-viewer label provider tooltip support. The tooltip
		defined for an attribute will appear on the row of the table or the
		parent node of the tree. The attribute description will also appear as
		a tooltip on the description columns if they exist.
	</p>

	<p>
		Control over the actual contents of the viewer is achieved through the
		<code>viewer-items-type</code>
		; one can here explicitly list attributes for inclusion
		using the
		<code>include</code>
		element, or one can set one or both of the <i>all</i> attributes; in
		the latter case, attributes can be excluded from the
		set using
		<code>exclude</code>. The <i>initialAllChecked</i> attribute, which defaults to true, indicates
		that if the attribute is new or undefined from a previous
		session, it will appear as checked; turn this off if you want new
		attributes to appear at first as unchecked.
	</p>

	<p>
		An attribute bearing the name given to this widget is written to the
		environment at each update/refresh; the value of the attribute is a
		string formed from the selected (checked) rows of the table using the
		<code>template-type</code>
		(the
		<code>value</code>
		element). The <i>pattern</i> can be any literal string embedding <i>@name</i>
		and <i>@value</i> tags as placeholders for the row's name and value;
		for instance, '@name="@value"' would generate a string of name-value
		assignments. The default <i>separator</i> between patterned segments
		is a single space.
	</p>

	<p>Below is a fuller example of the tree version of the attribute
		viewer. The text area above it displays the current value of its
		templated pattern string. The child rows reporting status, default,
		etc., cannot be selected or unselected (only the parent row can).
		Hovering over the name (here walltime) displays the tooltip.</p>
