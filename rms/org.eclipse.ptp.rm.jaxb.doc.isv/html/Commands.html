		<a name="CommandsParsers">Commands and Stream Parsers</a>
	</h2>

	<p>
		Commands are used by various parts of the control system in order to communicate with and control
		aspects of the target system resource manager. Commands are system calls, either to a local or remote OS,
		depending on the connection defined for the target system. 	A command is always 
		executed through a Java API (the "process builder") which typically results in a
		<code>bash -c</code> command (possibly via an ssh connection.) The first argument of 
		the command is the name/path of the executable. Arguments are then
		specified by an arbitrary number of
		<code>arg-type</code>
		elements.
	</p>
		
	<p>
		The following commands are supported by the <code>control-data-type</code>:
	</p>
	<table cellpadding="5" border="1" rules="all">
		<tr>
			<th>Element</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>start-up-command</code></td>
			<td>
				<p>
					A command that is run to initialize the configuration. This command is usually used
					to check for correct versions and to obtain dynamic configuration information (e.g.
					the list of available queues) from the target system
				</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>submit-interactive</code></td>
			<td>
				<p>
					Command to submit a purely interactive job to the target system. An interactive job
					is defined as one that the user would normally run from a login shell.
				</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>submit-interactive-debug</code></td>
			<td>
				<p>
					Debug version of the <code>submit-interactive</code> command.
				</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>submit-batch</code></td>
			<td>
				<p>
					Command to submit a batch job to the target system. This type of job
					submission is normally asynchronous, i.e. the user submits a job and
					at some later point the job will be run.
				</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>submit-batch-debug</code></td>
			<td>
				<p>
					Debug version of the <code>submit-batch</code> command.
				</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>get-job-status</code></td>
			<td>
				<p>
					A user-initiated (on-demand)
					request to refresh the status information for a submission. Normal
					(polled) updates, on the other hand, are the responsibility of the
					<code>monitor-type</code>
					component. The status command nevertheless needs to be implemented in
					most cases, as it will be called internally just after submission. 
				</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>terminate-job</code></td>
			<td>
				<p>
					A command to remove a job from the target system (terminating
					a running job if necessary). <b>Note</b>: if the submission type is interactive, the
					<code>terminate-job</code> command usually does not need to be implemented,
					as the process termination will be handled internally. However, in
					some cases (such as PBS -I) which require the interactive job to run
					as a pseudo-terminal, one may need this command in order to force its
					termination externally.
				</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>suspend-job</code></td>
			<td>
				<p>
					An optional command to suspend a running job.
				</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>resume-job</code></td>
			<td>
				<p>
					An optional command to resume a suspended job.
				</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>hold-job</code></td>
			<td>
				<p>
					An optional command to place a job on hold.
				</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>release-job</code></td>
			<td>
				<p>
					An optional command to release a held job.
				</p>
			</td>

				<p>
					A command that is run to clean up after a job has been launched.

				<p>
					An arbitrary command that can be associated with a button exposed through the
					launch configuration Resources tab
					(see further <a href="#Action">below</a>).
				</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	
	<p>
		<b>Note: A
		configuration may only define either a batch or an interactive launch mode, although
		each launch mode
		may have only two submission modes, run and debug.

	<h3>
		<a name="CommandTypes">Command Type</A>
	</h3>
	<p>
		A <code>command-type</code> element is used to define a command. 
	</p>
	
	<img alt="CommandType" src="images/08command.png" />

	<p>
		The following properties are available for a
		<code>command-type</code>
		element:
	</p>
	<table cellpadding="5" border="1" rules="all">
		<tr>
			<th>Property</th>
			<th>Description</th>
			<th>Default</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><i>name</i></td>
			<td>
				Specifies
				a name for the command.
			</td>
			<td>N/A</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><i>directory</i></td>
			<td>
				Specifies
				where the command will be executed. <b>This
				defaults to the "home" or working directory of the remote control
				connection (the <code>control.working.dir</code> attribute)</b>.
			</td>
			<td><code>control.working.dir</code></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><i>redirectStderr</i></td>
			<td>
				Specifies
				that both output and error
				streams are sent back on <code>stdout</code>.
			</td>
			<td>false</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><i>streamBufferLimit</i></td>
			<td>
				Specifies
				the buffer limit for stream readers.
			</td>
			<td>-1 (use system defined)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><i>replaceEnvironment</i></td>
			<td>
				Specifies that the environment set on the
				command should entirely replace the shell environment
			</td>
			<td>false (append the command environment)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><i>waitForId</i></td>
			<td>
				Specifies that the output stream
				for the command is being parsed for an id which will appear as an
				attribute in the environment during the command execution, and that the
				execution should not return until it sees this id. Most
				submit commands will have these semantics.
			</td>
			<td>false</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><i>ignoreExitStatus</i></td>
			<td>
				Prevents an error being thrown 
				in the case of non-zero exit of the command. This is usually used in the case of 
				a command that incorrectly returns a non-zero exit status.
			</td>
			<td>false</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><i>keepOpen</i></td>
			<td>
				Specifies that the command should be held open for potentially repeated
				redirection of input, such as when sending commands to an interactive
				partition that has been allocated by a batch scheduler. There can only be one such
				command open at a time.
			</td>
			<td>false</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><i>flags</i></td>
			<td>
				Specifies additional flags that will be passed to the remote connection.
				The <i>flags</i> property is an OR'd string of three possible values:
				<ul>
					<li>NONE</li>
					<li>ALLOCATE_PTY - allocates a pseudo-terminal</li>
					<li>FORWARD_X11 - enables X11 forwarding on the connection</li>
				</ul>
			</td>
			<td>NONE</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

	<p>
		Commands that set the <i>waitForId</i> property to true are treated specially. These are
		job submission commands which produce a job id to replace the internally generated uuid, and
		are responsible for setting the <i>status</i> property of the @jobId attribute.
	</p>
	<br>
	<table align="CENTER" border="1" cellpadding="5" rules="all">
		<tr>
			<th>COMMAND TYPE</th>
			<th>TOKENIZER STATES</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>batch</td>
			<td>SUBMITTED</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>interactive</td>
			<td>RUNNING</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>interactive, keepOpen</td>
			<td>SUBMITTED, RUNNING</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<br>
	<p>
		This table shows the various states that must be set depending on
		whether the command is interactive or batch. Commands that wait for
		an id must be provided with a <a href="#StreamParsers">stream tokenizer</a> 
		which recognizes and sets the @jobId state. Batch jobs will usually have a
		tokenizer which recognizes and sets the state to SUBMITTED when the job is
		submitted. The monitoring system will normally handle setting the job state
		to RUNNING (although this may also be done by the get-job-status command.)
		Interactive jobs, which just run the command as soon as possible,
		can set the job status directly to RUNNING. In the case of interactive
		jobs that set keepOpen=true (e.g., <code>qsub -I</code>
		for PBS, which also requires a pseudo-terminal to connect remotely),
		there will usually be a pause before the terminal job is actually
		scheduled. In order to allow the user to see that the job has been
		accepted and is pending, the tokenizer needs to set both SUBMITTED and
		RUNNING states, the latter when the job has actually started.
	</p>

	<p>
		Command <code>arg</code> elements, the <code>input</code> element, and the <code>environment</code> element all 
		make use of the <a href="Arguments"><code>arg-type</code></a> type for specifying arguments. For the
		<code>name-value-pair</code>
		type comprising the latter one can as simple alternative set the <i>value</i>
		attribute to a string (which will be resolved first in the current
		environment); finer-grained control over the resolution of the value,
		however, requires the use of the
		<code>arg</code>
		type. When there is
		<code>input</code>
		present, it is directed to the input stream of the command. If the <i>keepOpen</i>
		attribute is true, a check will be made to see if there already exists
		an open process (which is also alive), which will then be used;
		otherwise, the arguments are executed, then the input arguments are
		given to the process. With an open command/process, the input
		arguments can be fed repeatedly to the same process; this allows, for
		instance, for continuous testing of an interactive job in the same
		interactive session.
	</p>
	
	<h3>
		Execution Environment
	</h3>
	
	<p>
		The <code>environment</code> element allows attribute values to be passed to the command's environment
		prior to execution. 
	</p>

	<img alt="EnvironmentType" src="images/092environment.png" />

	<p>
		In the simplest form, the <i>name</i> and <i>value</i> properties are used to specify
		the name of the environment variable, and a corresponding value that can be resolved from the attribute
		map. Finer control of the environment variable can be obtained by using the <code>arg-type</code> type.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The <i>preserve</i> property can be used to override the <code>command-type</code> <i>replaceEnvironment</i> property.
		If this property is set to true, this environment variable will be passed to the remote command regardless
		of the <i>replaceEnvironment</i> property setting.
	</p>

	<h3>
		<a name="StreamParsers">Stream Parsers</a>
	</h3>

	<p>
		It is possible to attach a parser (which we also refer to as a tokenizer) to the
		output and error streams of any
		<code>command-type</code>
		in order to capture information and use it to side-effect existing
		attributes, or to generate new ones on the fly. While
		the parser is not completely general, it is capable of a wide range of
		tasks which would typically be required in the handling of output from
		batch and runtime systems.
	</p>
	
	<img alt="TokenizerType" src="images/090tokenizer.png" />

	<p>
	  	The main parser elements used by the tokenizer are
		<code>target</code>, <code>match</code>, and <code>test</code>.
		See the <a
			href="#TokenizerExamples">tokenizer examples</a> demonstrating
		various usage scenarios.
	</p>
	<p>
		The
		<code>type</code>
		element will most commonly not be set, meaning the built-in parser
		will be used; however, it is possible to implement a custom parser as
		a contribution to the
		<code>org.eclipse.ptp.rm.jaxb.core.streamParserTokenizer</code>
		extension point, in which case this element should be set to its
		extension id. Note that the extension requires the class to implement
		<code>org.eclipse.ptp.rm.jaxb.control.internal.IStreamParserTokenizer</code>, 
		which is a Runnable interface with an initialize method which passes
		in any job id plus the current environment map; the details of such a
		parser's implementation are not, however, configured from the XML
		document.
	</p>

	<p>
		The built-in tokenizer can read the stream in two different ways. If <i>delim</i>
		is provided, the stream is split using the indicated value. The string
		should only be one character in length (escaped or non-escaped).
		Provision is made for the '\r\n' (Windows) two-character delimiter
		internally; in this case the delimiter should be set to "\r" (however,
		as already mentioned, PTP does not generally guarantee that system
		calls will work on Windows). Setting <i>includeDelim</i> means that
		the delimiter will appear as the last char on the returned stream
		segment.
	</p>

	<p>
		The second way to read from the stream is to provide a <i>maxMatchLen</i>
		size; what this indicates is that whatever substring needs to be found
		on the stream will not exceed this length. The stream is then read in
		swatches of <i>maxMatchLen</i>, with the internal buffer set to twice
		this size, so that each successive read shifts the buffer to the
		"left" by one length. This guarantees that all such substrings will
		eventually be matched.
	</p>

	<p>
		Sometimes a sort of "look-ahead" paradigm is necessary. For instance,
		one may need to match a segment or segments whose position is defined
		from the end of the output, but you do not know in advance the actual
		stream length. In this case, one can opt to read until the end of the
		stream (<i>all</i>="true"), retaining only the last <i>N</i>
		buffer-lengths or delimited segments, as indicated by the <i>save</i>
		field. When the parser reaches the end of the stream, it will then
		apply the various targets to each saved segment in order.
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>applyToAll</i> is discussed further under
		<code>target</code>
		. The
		<code>exit-on</code>
		element indicates that the tokenizer should quit immediately when it
		encounters this pattern;
		<code>exit-after</code>
		indicates that the tokenizer should quit when it encounters this
		pattern, but should first apply the current segment to its targets.
	</p>

	<h4>
		<a name="TargetType">Target Type</a>
	</h4>

	<img alt="TargetType" src="images/091target.png" />

	<p>
		A tokenizer may be given any number of
		<code>target</code>
		elements. The target denotes a particular value (object) currently in,
		or to be written to, the environment, which will be side-effected on
		the basis of the result of the tokenization. A target in turn contains
		<code>match</code>
		elements and
		<code>test</code>
		elements; the former are run as part of the stream processing; the
		latter are run after the stream processing has been completed. The
		optional
		<code>else</code>
		element is applied only if there are no other tests defined or if none
		of the defined tests succeed).
	</p>

	<p>
		The target object is either to be constructed at match time, or it
		pre-exists in the environment. If not constructed, <i>ref</i> points to the name of the
		<code>attribute</code>
		in the environment (recall that for the runtime job identifier, <i>@jobId</i>
		is used).
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Note</b>: when new targets are constructed, there is a merge
		operation at the end of tokenization which attempts to combine objects
		into a single instance identified by their <i>name</i> attribute. This
		assumes that such names will be unique and that any other values to be
		set on the object which are not explicitly bound in some way to that
		name via the match pattern will appear on the stream before a new name
		does (see ex. 5 in <a href="#TokenizerExamples">tokenizer examples</a>).
		<b><i>The default behavior of this merge is that it will fail
				if two objects with the same name but differing values are generated
				by the parsing.</i> (This excludes <code>add</code> and <code>put</code>
			operations which create a list or map; in these cases, the two
			collections or maps will be combined into one. This does <i>NOT</i>
			work, however, for <code>append</code> actions.) To allow duplicates,
			set the <i>allowOverwrites</i> to true; in this case, successive
			duplicates simply replace the preceding object. </b>
	</p>

	<p>The default behavior of the tokenizer read-match sequence is as
		follows:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>read from the stream either a set number of chars or until
			the delimiter is found;</li>
		<li>for each target:
			<ul>
				<li>for each match:
					<ul>
						<li>if the match is positive, process each of the actions,
							and go to (1).</li>
					</ul>
			</ul></li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		Only one qualifying target is processed for any given segment read,
		and for the given target, the first pattern matched is the one
		processed for its actions. This is basically the "OR" semantics of
		normal logic programming; hence <i>the implementer must be careful
			to arrange the matches inside a target in such a way that the more
			specific match patterns precede the more general</i>.
	</p>
	<p>Three boolean fields allow you to modify this behavior.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>The <i>applyToAll</i> field on the <code>tokenizer-type</code>
			element means take the unmatched part of the read stream and pass it
			to the next target, even if there was a previous match; this allows
			you to capture more than one regex pattern per stream segment (see
			ex. 6 in <a href="#TokenizerExamples">tokenizer examples</a>).</li>
		<li>The <i>matchAll</i> field on the <code>target-type</code>
			element means do not try to match an already matched expression until
			all the others are matched (i.e., a logical AND instead of OR governs
			the set of matches at successive calls to the target match
			operation); this allows one to use, for instance, .* repeatedly but
			set different fields of the object with the resulting match (see ex.
			5 in <a href="#TokenizerExamples">tokenizer examples</a>).</li>
		<li>The <i>moveToTop</i> field on the <code>match-type</code>
			element indicates to the tokenizer that the matched target be
			promoted to first position in the list of targets. This is useful
			when there is an ordering which expects types of attributes
			to be grouped in sequence on the stream (see ex. 4 in <a
			href="#TokenizerExamples">tokenizer examples</a>).</li>
	</ol>

	<p>When a match is found, the set of action types it contains are
		all applied.</p>

	<h4>
		<a name="MatchType">Match Type</a>
	</h4>

	<img alt="MatchType" src="images/10match.jpeg" />

	<p>Each of these types corresponds to an action to be taken on the
		indicated field of the target object.</p>

	<table border="1" cellpadding="5" align="center" rules="all">
		<tr>
			<th>Element</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		<tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>set</code></td>
			<td>sets the value of that field</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>append</code></td>
			<td>adds to a string buffer, whose string value will be set on
				the field</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>add</code></td>
			<td>adds to a list to which the value of that field will be set</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>put</code></td>
			<td>places a key-value pair in a map to which the value of that
				field will be set</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>throw</code></td>
			<td>throws an exception and (optionally) also sets the value of
				the field</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

	<p>
		The actions listed here all have
		<code>entry-type</code>
		children, either single (
		<code>set, throw</code>
		) or potentially multiple. All of these except
		<code>throw</code>
		also allow you to force the creation of a new object (<i>forceNewObject</i>)
		each time it is applied; the new object then replaces the current one
		for successive actions in the match.
	</p>

	<h4>
		<a name="EntryType">Entry Type</a>
	</h4>

	<img alt="EntryType" src="images/11entry.jpeg" />

	<p>
		This value-abstraction allows one to set <i>key</i> (for maps) and <i>value</i>
		as literals or references to other attributes to be
		resolved in the current environment; to reference the matched segment
		parts one sets <i>keyIndex</i> and <i>valueIndex</i> if the regex was
		used to split the segment; otherwise, <i>keyGroup</i> and <i>valueGroup</i>
		refer to the capture group of the regex pattern, with group 0
		referring to the entire match.
	</p>

	<h4>
		<a name="TestType">Test Type</a>
	</h4>

	<img alt="TestType" src="images/12test.jpeg" />

	<p>
		As mentioned <a href="#TargetType">above</a>, the
		<code>test-type</code>
		elements are all run after the tokenization has reached the end of the
		stream. This class of actions is useful for setting values based on
		other values produced during tokenization. A test is one or more
		comparison operations plus a set of actions to apply to the target
		fields in the case of either success or failure (the "else" element);
		see ex. 3 or the "get-job-status" example in <a
			href="#TokenizerExamples">tokenizer examples</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		The <i>op</i> attribute can be one of the following comparisons:
	</p>

	<table align="center">
		<tr>
			<td>EQ</td>
			<td>:</td>
			<td>equals</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>LT</td>
			<td>:</td>
			<td>less than</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>LE</td>
			<td>:</td>
			<td>less than or equal to</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>GT</td>
			<td>:</td>
			<td>greater than</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>GE</td>
			<td>:</td>
			<td>greater than or equal to</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

	<p>
		When the operation is set to one of these, it is expected that the two
		<code>value</code>
		elements will be used. As usual, these elements can be literals or can
		contain variables to be resolved into a string type;
		<code>#FIELD</code>
		refers to the value of the given field on the current target; the
		strings will be converted in conformity with the inferred (primitive)
		type of the comparison. The
		<code>else</code>
		element also pertains to comparison tests; the actions listed there
		will be taken upon failure of the comparison.
	</p>

	<p>
		The <i>op</i> attribute can also be a logical operator [AND, OR, NOT],
		in which case the embedded
		<code>test</code>
		object should be used; these can be nested to an arbitrary depth, but
		of course must bottom out in a comparison operation.
