	<h1 id="top">IBM Platform LSF</h1>
	<p>This section describes how to set up and use a run configuration using
		IBM Platform Load Sharing Facility (LSF), as a target system configuration
		within the <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.ptp.doc.user/html/toc.html">Parallel Tools Platform</a> (PTP),  
		to support batch LSF job submission.
	</p>
	<h2 id="config">Initial Setup</h2>
	<p>The user account that you will be submitting jobs to on the remote system must include an invocation of profile.lsf, 
		cshrc.lsf or perl.lsf as part of the login shell script, depending on that account's shell command processor. By invoking 
		the appropriate script, you ensure that the account is set up for PTP to run LSF commands.</p>
	<p>In addition, when you define the connection to the remote host, make sure the <b>Use login shell</b> checkbox
		 in the <b>Generic Remote Host</b> dialog is checked. Note that this dialog opens in simplified mode. 
		 In order to check the <b>Use login shell</b> checkbox, you must click the <b>Advanced</b> button then check the 
		 checkbox.
	</p>

	<h2 id="submit">Submitting a Batch Job</h2>
	<p>To submit a batch job, use the <b>Run</b> menu or the 
		<b>run</b> icon to select an existing run configuration or to create a new run configuration. The run configuration should be a 
		<b>Parallel Application</b> run configuration.</p>
	<p>Next, select the <b>LSF-Generic-Batch</b> option from the Target System Configuration drop down widget.</p>
	<p>Then select the connection for the remote system from the <b>Connection name</b> drop down widget or click the <b>New</b>
	 	button to create a new connection to the remote system.</p>
	<img src="./images/rms-lsf1.png"><br>
	<h2 id="options">Specifying Job Submission Options</h2>
	<p>After you have selected the LSF target system configuration and the connection, the resources tab of the run
	   configuration dialog will be populated with a set of tabbed panes where you fill in the values for any LSF job 
	   submission parameters you need.
	</p>	
	<p>The LSF job submission options are organized into several tabbed panes</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Job Submission</b>, such as job queue, job name, and login shell</li>
		<br>
		<img src="./images/rms-lsf3.png">
		<br>	
		<li><b>Scheduling</b>, such as dependencies, requested dispatch time, and reservation id</li>
		<br>
		<img src="./images/rms-lsf5.png">
		<br>
		<li><b>Resources</b>, such as host names and number of processors</li>
		<br>
		<img src="./images/rms-lsf6.png">
		<br>
		<li><b>Limits</b>, such as CPU time limit, file size limit, and memory limit</li>
		<br>
		<img src="./images/rms-lsf7.png">
		<br>
		<li><b>I/O</b>, specifying handling for stdin, stdout and stderr</li>
		<br>
		<img src="./images/rms-lsf8.png">
		<br>
		<li><b>Notifications</b>, specifying notifications for job dispatch and completion</li>
		<br>
		<img src="./images/rms-lsf9.png">
	</ul>
	<p>In addition, the <b>Advanced</b> tab displays a list of all LSF job submission options where you can also fill 
	   in the values you need.</p>
	<img src="./images/rms-lsf2.png">
	<p>The <b>Job Queue</b> and <b>Application Profile</b> options on the <b>Job Submission</b> tab and the
	   <b>Reservation ID</b> on the <b>Scheduling</b> tab are comprised of a text entry field and a <b>List</b>
	   button. You can either fill in the value in the text entry field or click the <b>List</b> button to get a dialog where
	   you can select from one of the available choices.</p>
	<p>The selection dialog displayed when you click the <b>List</b> button looks like the following image</p>
	<img src="./images/rms-lsf4.png">
	<p>You select a value from the dialog by clicking the entry in the left column and clicking the <b>OK</b>button.</p>
	<p>Once you have filled in the values in the <b>Resources</b> tab, fill in in the remaining tabs as needed and click the <b>Run</b> button. </p>
